# home-user-backpack-v2
[HUB: Home User Backpack](https://homeuserbackpack.herokuapp.com)

This project was initially created for the Femme Hacks 2021 Hackathon. Februrary 5-6, 2021.

As college students ourselves, we noticed that virtual events hosted by student orgs were starting to get repetitive. We feel the frustration of having our college social activities be online.

Home-User-Backpack is a hub (lol) for college event planners to help virtually connect classmates, student committees, and members of student organizations.
HUB crowdsources all the fun, remote activities on the internet and organizes them into one centralized hub to make event planning easier and diversify the activity options at these virtual socials. 

## Revisiting The Project

Since the beginning of Covid, I wanted to create the HUB app. It wasn't until the Femme Hacks 2021 Hackathon, I decided to pursue this passion project. I worked with wonderful people to create a mockup and working prototype. Unfortunately, we were not able to complete the project. Because this project meant a lot to me, I decided to revisit it and start over and applying new skills and technologies (specifically React).

## Design Process
We created user personas, hi-fi mockups, and a working prototype for our website using Figma and Notion.
We identified our problem statements and user pain points to determine that our objective should be to crowdsource all the fun, remote activities on the internet and organize them into one centralized hub to make event planning easier and diversify the activity options at virtual events.

### Target User
mostly students, because well...
1) weâ€™re all students, so we feel the frustration of having our college social activities be online. 
2) As student leaders, we know how hard it is to come up with fun socials for which people are willing to do another Zoom call ðŸ˜”

## Process
We used
[Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/cjvKwiitQHielJbfUN1URJ/femmehacks-project?node-id=35%3A773) to prototype our web application. We were able to build the website from scratch with HTML, add styling & interactivity with CSS and JavaScript, and built a filtering feature for different activity categories using Firebase.
